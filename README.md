# REACT JS - Random Color Generator

Hello, World!

This is my first ReactJS project! That's right, the well-known random color generator component.

### Details

This is the first component of a more complex app i would like to develop in the future, which includes color pallette generators as well as color pickers. (coolors.co is my main inspiration).

My main goal is to practice functional React JS and components style and it helped me have a better understanding of how React re-renders components on states updates when using the useState hook.

Any feedback would be very appreciated! :)
